# Dockerized Flask Application with MySQL

This project is a simple Flask-based web application that stores and retrieves messages from a MySQL database. The application is containerized using Docker to demonstrate basic containerization and service integration.

## 🚀 Features

- Flask web application for data input and display
- MySQL database for persistent storage
- Dockerized setup for easy deployment
- Separate containers for application and database

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- MySQL
- Docker
- Linux

## 📦 Project Structure

- app.py — Flask application logic
- run.py — Application entry point
- requirements.txt — Python dependencies
- Dockerfile — Instructions to build Docker image

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The Flask application runs inside a Docker container.
2. A MySQL container runs as the database service.
3. The Flask app connects to MySQL and stores user messages.
4. Data can be retrieved and viewed through the web interface.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was built to:
- Learn Docker containerization
- Understand how to connect services (Flask + MySQL)
- Practice building and running containerized applications
